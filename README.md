# Water-Quality

This project is designed to assess water quality and determine whether it is safe for consumption. The system takes water parameter data (such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, and other chemical indicators) and uses a machine learning model to classify the water as potable or non-potable.

By analyzing these parameters, the model provides a prediction that helps in decision-making for water safety and quality management.
